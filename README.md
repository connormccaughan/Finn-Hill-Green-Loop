## Overview
This project involved creating a custom shapefile to map a proposed "Green Loop" — a continuous green space network — surrounding the Finn Hill neighborhood area in Kirkland, WA. The work was completed in collaboration with the Finn Hill Neighborhood Association, aiming to support local planning, public engagement, and environmental advocacy efforts.

The resulting shapefile and associated map visualizations are intended to serve as a planning resource for community members and local government stakeholders.

## Objectives
- Design and digitize a geospatial representation of a proposed green loop pathway.
- Integrate multiple green space features (parks, trails, open spaces) into a single connected route.
- Provide a GIS-ready dataset for use in planning discussions and grant applications.

## Tools & Skills Used
- **Software:** ArcGIS Pro
- **Data Handling:** Feature creation, layer styling, attribute table management
- **Techniques:** Digitizing, spatial referencing, shapefile creation, map layout design
- **File Formats:** ESRI Shapefile (.shp), Layer Package (.lpk), PDF map export

## Data Sources
- Base map layers from City of Kirkland GIS Data
- Publicly available parks and green space datasets
- Field observations and input from community group members

## Methodology
1. **Data Gathering**  
   Imported base maps, green space layers, and existing trail/path data from open data sources.

2. **Route Planning**  
   Worked with community members to define the intended path of the green loop, integrating existing infrastructure and identifying gaps.

3. **Digitization**  
   Created a new shapefile layer in ArcGIS Pro and manually digitized the loop based on planned alignments and adjustments to ensure cost-efficiency.

4. **Map Production**  
   Styled the layer for clarity, created a professional map layout, and exported both the shapefile and a PDF map for distribution.

## Results
- **Final Deliverables:**
  - Custom shapefile representing the proposed green loop route
  - Styled map layout showing the loop in context with parks, streets, and neighborhood boundaries
